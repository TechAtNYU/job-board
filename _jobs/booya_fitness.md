With customers who say we’re the most engagement fitness platform they’ve ever seen, we’re now looking for a brilliant marketing mind to help us reach a global audience.

We have a fun, collaborative and hardworking team that cares deeply about helping individuals find workouts that makes sense for their lifestyle, fitness ability, interest, and community. This position is a great fit for anyone interested in joining a high growth startup in the early days where they can help shape the vision of the company.
