C4Q, a tech nonprofit based in Queens, NYC, seeks dedicated interns to join our team during the fall. Despite the incredible promise of tech as a vehicle to the middle class, significant barriers to entry cause a lack of access to these growing opportunities. We work to build a world in which everyone has the opportunity to pursue a career in tech.

We're fortunate to be funded by leaders in technology, business, and philanthropy -- including the Robin Hood Foundation, Blackstone, Google for Entrepreneurs, Arbor Brothers, and many others. Our flagship program is Access Code, which teaches adults from underserved communities to code and gain jobs in tech. This program raises graduate income from $26,000 to $73,000 a year -- pioneering pathways from poverty to the middle class, and beyond. Access Code has been featured by several major news sources such as Fast Company and prominent venture capitalist, Fred Wilson, on his blog, A VC.

Whatâ€™s needed is a blueprint for a new kind of innovation hub, one that embraces a diverse and wide-ranging community and transforms existing notions of what a responsible and sustainable tech ecosystem can be. C4Q operates at the confluence of the local Queens community and the tech industry, working to bridge the two through our integrated programs.

We are a small but growing team in which you would be an important and integral member. Available positions range widely from Education Programs Intern to Technical Intern.
