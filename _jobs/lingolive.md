Lingo Live is changing the way people communicate. We connect foreign language learners with a live, native professional for one-on-one lessons anytime and anywhere online. Students progress through our rigorous, PhD-linguist curriculum through online lessons whenever it is convenient. We help companies with products that touch billions of people's daily lives by teaching their employees to gain the critical language skills they need to grow their business. Companies look to us to grow their culture and improve communicative across the organization. 

We are looking for an MBA in Residence to lead our Customer Discovery efforts. As our MBA in Residence, you will help us better understand potential customers by conducting Customer Discovery interviews, primarily by working your school network, with HR and Training & Development professionals. 

Specifically, you will setup interviews, both in person and over the phone, with alumni from your school who are now industry veterans in the HR / Training & Development space in some of the largest organizations in the world. The goal of your efforts will be to clearly define what an ideal language learning product looks like from their perspective and distill that feedback into actionable product strategy for Lingo Live. 

You will work closely with our Director of Business Development, Chris Killiany, who brings nearly a decade of sales experience, as well as the CEO of the company, Tyler Muse, both of whom will ensure you have the information and tools needed to be successful. 

As our MBA in Residence, you will need to have:

1. The ability to interact with business professionals through email and over the phone in an efficient, polite and timely manner

2. The ability to effectively conduct detailed interviews evaluating the customer’s problem, unique needs, and industry experience

3. A positive attitude and a willingness to share new ideas based on lessons learned from client interactions

Additionally, as we are a startup, you will be relied on to wear many hats. There are tons of different things going on and we’ll need to pull you in on everything from sales to marketing to design and curriculum development pending your availability.

Last semester, we had the pleasure of working with Jason, an MBA Candidate at the Columbia Business School. Jason contributed the following:

- Over 50 interviews with CBS alumni (both over the phone and in person)

- A detailed Customer Discovery report detailing interviewees’ current investment in language training, global operations and plans for expansion, detailed feedback on language learning effectiveness, B2B SaaS effectiveness, and general challenges faced by multinational organizations; this data factored into our Investor Presentation which lead to $500k+ in investment

- A customer for Lingo Live, from a Customer Discovery interview, which generated over $3,000 in revenue

- Represented Lingo Live at our ERA demo day and met over 500 investors

This is a non-paid position offering the ability to work at your own pace / schedule for one of the hottest startups in NYC. Commission will be offered on any sales that come from Customer Discovery interviews you arrange and you will also receive a letter of recommendation at the end of the semester.

You may also participate in any product workshops, investor roundtables, ping pong games and other events going on in our office space regularly.

Interested parties should contact jobs@lingo-live.com and put MBA in Residence in the subject line and attach a resume including phone number.

We look forward to working with you!
