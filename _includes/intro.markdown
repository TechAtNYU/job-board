#About Blank Slate

Blank Slate is a responsive framework for Jekyll. It is intended to make developing responsive microsites faster.

Blank Slate is abstracted from sites I've built in the past. I am gradually simplifying it and testing it through use. I hope it will one day have only the essentials in markup, style, and JS scaffolding.
